    <h2>Cache Concepts from RFC 2616</h2>
    <p><strong>Cache:</strong> A local store of responses used by clients or intermediaries to reduce latency and bandwidth (Sections 1.2, 13).</p>
    <p><strong>Freshness:</strong> Defines how long a cached response is valid, based on headers like Expires and Cache-Control: max-age (Section 13.2).</p>
    <p><strong>Cache-Control:</strong> A header that specifies caching directives for requests and responses (Section 14.9).</p>
    <p><strong>Validators:</strong> Mechanisms such as ETag and Last-Modified that allow revalidation of cached responses (Section 13.3).</p>
    <p><strong>Age Header:</strong> Indicates how long a response has been stored in caches, in seconds (Section 14.6).</p>
